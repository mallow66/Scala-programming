# Scala programming

This repository contains some code that I wrote for the purpose of learning Scala.
Technically, Scala is a blend of object-oriented and functional programming concepts in a statically typed language.

From a while I was so interrested in functional programming, (used Haskell to learn it). Scala's functional programming constructs make it efficient to build intersting thing quickly from simple parts

I really liked the concept of Scala programming because it merged two concepts : object-oriented, and functional programming

the majority of the code concern: 

* Collections (Lists, Maps, Arrays, ArrayBuffers, ListBuffers ..) 
* Case classes and pattern matching
* Traits
* Extractors
* Composition and inheritance
